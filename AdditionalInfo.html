            <h2>Luxury Wedding Planner in Italy</h2>
            <p>Welcome to White Emotion’s world of weddings in Italy, where attention to detail and deep respect for the couple’s tastes and personality constitute the guiding principles of our work as luxury wedding planners.

From the most intimate of elopements to lavish parties welcoming over three hundred guests, everything starts from a highly personalized briefing to ensure that every detail is carefully tailored to our clients’ individual needs.

Our hope is that the following selection of weddings in Italy, organized over the years by our team of luxury wedding planners throughout the Italian peninsula, from Piedmont to Sicily, can convey White Emotion’s style as well as some of the versatility and passion we put in every single event we plan.

Richly colored or total white, featuring luxuriant floral embellishments or minimal décor, the style of our weddings in Italy goes from country to as classic as it can get. Whichever of the infinite ways of decorating a wedding you may choose, what truly matters to us is that your style, personality and wedding concept are accurately reflected in our creations.

Encompassing the best picks of some of the luxury weddings planned in Italy by the team of White Emotion, this portfolio is also a wedding planner’s advice to all couples on the importance of choosing their photographers with great care. After all, the photographer’s role is to tell the story of your wedding, and the moments captured on the most memorable day of your lives will stay with you forever, enabling you to live again and again such a priceless and unique event. It is not by chance that we often speak of ‘unrepeatable’ moments, and a good photographer is one who keeps that in mind throughout the day.

Cooperation and teamwork are obviously key to turning a dream wedding into reality. That is especially true if you’re planning a destination wedding in Italy from abroad. That’s why we make of seamless communication with the couple our top priority, to make sure you feel as if you were planning your wedding in Italy right by our side, even though you might not be able to visit the country much earlier than a couple of days before getting married.

Not last by importance, a good wedding planner can be judged based on the areas in which they provide support and advice and by how valuable that support is, but we also believe that it is the love, dedication and pride we take in our work that truly define White Emotion as one of the best teams of luxury wedding planners in Italy.</p>
